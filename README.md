# inky-raffles

Raffles from Inky's Art Club for selecting community members to send physical art out to ❤️

## Data Source (Inky NFT Holders)

We use [HGraph](https://hgraph.io) to collect all the accounts and respective balances before ingesting them.

## Analytics

First we collate all the data to generate figures on how many votes/entries there are and how many accounts that covers. We ignore Treasury balances that includes our balance and [Hedera Sentient](https://hederasentient.com/).

From here we will share the figures of the total amount of entries for accounts, then we will pick one of the accounts by random.

> Note: The account owner will have **72 Hours** (3 working days) to claim and prove ownership, by sending 1 HBAR to the Inky treasury.

If the owner fails to appear or prove ownership we will randomly select another accounts until a winner is picked and verified, at which time the artwork or any other giveaway will be sent out, anywhere in the world.
